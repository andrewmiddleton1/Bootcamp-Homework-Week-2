I designed this "About Me" website with my company in mind (AJM Finance)
The website is based largely on Bootstrap templates, which allow the website to respond depending on the size of the screen (including for mobile phone use and tablet use). This also includes the images/portfolio section
The navbar is a bootstrap template and remains consistent across the three pages
